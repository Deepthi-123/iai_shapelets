# iai_shapelets
This branch of ```iai_shapelets``` contains the evaluation source code and dataset from the paper "Multidimensional Time Series Shapelets Reliably Detect and Classify Contact Events in Force Measurements of Wiping Actions", currently under review at Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L). 

We will release both the source code and the dataset as soon as publication has been confirmed.
